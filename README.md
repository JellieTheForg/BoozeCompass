Alrihgt I accidentally deleted this when i was fixing something so here it is again:

This is my booze compass, which points to the nearest LCBO/store that sells alcohol in ontario. 
It is meant to work with a raspberry pi and a few modules, namely; A SSD1306 screen, a NEO6M GPS, and a HMC5883L compass. 
There are three main python codes:
Boozevisual and lcbovisual both use pygame, so you can run it using a regular screen.
lcbovis_nopygame(awesome name i know) DOESN'T use pygame crazily enough, and just renders the compass using a library for the screen instead. 

I still don't have the modules yet(thanks to aliexpress), that's why a bunch of code is commented out. 

I will continue to make this as good as I can in the future, that's about it thanks for reading.
